My dearest Dillon,

Happy Birthday to Moo Deng's sexy cosplay actor :)

If you were a dog (which about 85% of you is, in the most endearing way) you would be 189 years old today!

Year 26 was quite wild with possible job changes, dropping the hammer, building a bed, the ole relationship stuff, traveling the eastern seaboard, and getting a much-deserved raise/promotion.
It's been encouraging to walk alongside you this past year (minus three months) and see how you have tackled everything. I admire your determinedness, intentionality, and patience with what life hands to you. 

There are a plethora of attributes I admire about you, but one I have come to love this past year is the way you care for others, even when it's inconvenient. From going out of your way to care for me and my gimpy leg to sacrificing a whole weekend for 40 crackheads (middle schoolers), people can count on you to be a dependable person in times of need. I often recall the time you made food for the Turners when you didn't really know them, and that seemingly insignificant gesture speaks volumes about who you are. You make people feel seen by how you care for them - which is truly an incredible gift and one I find joy in experiencing each day.

Also, you are genuinely funny (gonna inflate the hell out of your ego now), and you truly make me laugh more than anyone. I have a lot of fun with you, and you make even 2 am at an IHOP in Dallas feel a little less daunting. Being around you feels like driving with the windows down along a winding backroad, letting the crisp warmth of an Appalachian spring day flood the space. I'm glad I have someone that makes home feel a little closer to Texas *wink wink*

So here's to year 27, I'm excited to see the places you go this year!

Your's truly,
Cass
